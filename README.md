## Overview
Deployed and optimized a real-time smart surveillance system that aids the observer by detecting anomalies. Achieved a 0.25-second inference time per frame with YOLOv8, 2-second feature extraction per batch with I3D, and near-instantaneous anomaly scoring on GTX 1660 GPU with RTFM that achieved a 95.6% AUC in detecting anomalies in surveillance videos.


This thesis presents the development and implementation 
of a real-time anomaly surveillance system. The system 
leverages advanced techniques from computer vision, machine 
learning, and artificial intelligence to enable proactive 
monitoring and detection of anomalies in various environments. 
Through the utilization of state-of-the-art models and 
algorithms, the system provides real-time analysis of multiple 
camera feeds, automatically detects anomalies, and triggers 
appropriate actions for a timely response. The system offers a 
user-friendly interface, customizable settings, and integration 
with email notifications for efficient anomaly management. 
Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the 
effectiveness and practicality of the system in enhancing 
situational awareness and improving overall security.
